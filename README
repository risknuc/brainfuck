Implementation of a Brainfuck interpreter

Here's a simple Brainfuck interpreter written 
entirely in C. It's worth mentioning that 
Brainfuck is not a serious programming language; 
it's more of a tool for learning C and pointers. 
It really helps to understand these concepts in 
practice. Additionally, it is provided as a 
command-line tool:

    BRAINFUCK_INTERPRETER <brainfuck_code> [<args>...] (optional)

The interpreter takes Brainfuck code, which is 
better written in quotes, as well as arguments 
for the code that are used in the key sign. 
Hereâ€™s the command to compile the project using gcc:

    gcc -g -std=c11 brainfuck_interpreter.c -o BRAINFUCK_INTERPRETER

Congratulations! You now have a Brainfuck interpreter 
on your PC.
